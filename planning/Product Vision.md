#Project Title
Title: Smart Community Issue Reporting System

#Project Theme and SDG Focus
SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities

##The Issue/Problem
During this time and day of age, many communities still face local infrastructure issues such as broken streetlights,
illegal garbage dumping, potholes, etc. But, there is a lack of a easy access to report these issues to the 
authorities, instead need to go through a rigorous process of paperwork and so on.

##The Solution
We will create a web application prototype that allows users (in this case, local community), to capture,
tag, track, and report the issues to the authority

##Target Audience
There will be two primary stakeholders in this project which are Local residents (Reporters) and Community Administrators (Resolvers).

##Value Proposition
By streamlining communication between citizens and urban managers, the software optimizes community engagement
and ensures a safer, more sustainable living environment.
